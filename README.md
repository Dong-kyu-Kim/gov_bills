government bills database design and delivery

OVERVIEW
Intent is to build a database of government reps, bills, and vote tallies that can be used to quickly advise a person how they would vote vs how their representative votes. 

This data is used to inform voters and further political knowledge in the United States

Ethical considerations 
With the world at large's media environment and so much political spin out there its hard to disecern fact from opinion.
This data base can assist by clarifying what a representative's actual record is without you have to dig through 1000 websites.
Having this data at your fingertips at a moments notice will help you make informed decisions as you head to the voing booth
The hope is that with a more informed public, the better of a society we might create.
Of course with any system there could be corruption, but perhaps we can install safeguards, although we don't yet know what those may be.
